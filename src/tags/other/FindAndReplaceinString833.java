/**
 * To some string S, we will perform some replacement operations that replace
 * groups of letters with new ones (not necessarily the same size).
 * 
 * Each replacement operation has 3 parameters: a starting index i, a source
 * word x and a target word y. The rule is that if x starts at position i in the
 * original string S, then we will replace that occurrence of x with y. If not,
 * we do nothing.
 * 
 * For example, if we have S = "abcd" and we have some replacement operation i =
 * 2, x = "cd", y = "ffff", then because "cd" starts at position 2 in the
 * original string S, we will replace it with "ffff".
 * 
 * Using another example on S = "abcd", if we have both the replacement
 * operation i = 0, x = "ab", y = "eee", as well as another replacement
 * operation i = 2, x = "ec", y = "ffff", this second operation does nothing
 * because in the original string S[2] = 'c', which doesn't match x[0] = 'e'.
 * 
 * All these operations occur simultaneously. It's guaranteed that there won't
 * be any overlap in replacement: for example, S = "abc", indexes = [0, 1],
 * sources = ["ab","bc"] is not a valid test case.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: S = "abcd", indexes = [0,2], sources = ["a","cd"], targets =
 * ["eee","ffff"] Output: "eeebffff" Explanation: "a" starts at index 0 in S, so
 * it's replaced by "eee". "cd" starts at index 2 in S, so it's replaced by
 * "ffff". Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: S = "abcd", indexes = [0,2], sources = ["ab","ec"], targets =
 * ["eee","ffff"] Output: "eeecd" Explanation: "ab" starts at index 0 in S, so
 * it's replaced by "eee". "ec" doesn't starts at index 2 in the original S, so
 * we do nothing. Notes:
 * 
 * 0 <= indexes.length = sources.length = targets.length <= 100 0 < indexes[i] <
 * S.length <= 1000 All characters in given inputs are lowercase letters.
